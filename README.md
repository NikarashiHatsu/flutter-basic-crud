# Flutter CRUD App
This repository consist a Flutter Application with basic CRUD operation.
I will use this repo as a reference if somehow I forgot how to do the 'operation' because somehow I easily forgot things.

About the API, please never use my API because it's not the best practice, it's lack of security. It's intended to be a quick test over Flutter App.

## Where's the API Repository?
It's here, over the /api folder. It's written using PHP. Have a copy of it and serve it on local server or something. Just don't use this API over public network. Again, it lacks of security.
